That said, if Pull Request's author is abandoning it for more than 30 days, we may mark such Pull Request as stale. We may take over the work that is needed to finish it.\nIf Pull Request author grants write access to their fork to the webpack Documentation team we will commit directly to your branch and finish the work. In other cases, we may have to start over by ourselves or by delegating it to willing community members. This may render your Pull Request redundant and it might get closed as a part of the cleanup process."))}r.isMDXComponent=!0,a.default=r}}]);
